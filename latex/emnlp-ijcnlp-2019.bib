Our method generates misspelling replacement candidates and ranks them according to their semantic fit, by calculating a weighted cosine similarity between the vectorized representation of a candidate and the misspelling context. We greatly outperform two baseline off-the-shelf spelling correction tools on a manually annotated MIMIC-III test set, and counter the frequency bias of an optimized noisy channel model, showing that neural embeddings can be successfully exploited to include context-awareness in a spelling correction model.",

To detect and correct various types of spelling errors in consumer health questions, we developed a distributable spell-checking tool, CSpell, that handles nonword errors, real-word errors, word boundary infractions, punctuation errors, and combinations of the above.We developed a novel approach of using dual embedding within Word2vec for context-dependent corrections. This technique was used in combination with dictionary-based corrections in a 2-stage ranking system. We also developed various splitters and handlers to correct word boundary infractions. All correction approaches are integrated to handle errors in consumer health questions.Our approach achieves an F1 score of 80.93\\% and 69.17\\% for spelling error detection and correction, respectively.The dual-embedding model shows a significant improvement (9.13\\%) in F1 score compared with the general practice of using cosine similarity with word vectors in Word2vec for context ranking. Our 2-stage ranking system shows a 4.94\\% improvement in F1 score compared with the best 1-stage ranking system.CSpell improves over the state of the art and provides near real-time automatic misspelling detection and correction in consumer health questions. The software and the CSpell test set are available at https://umlslex.nlm.nih.gov/cSpell.}",

abstract = "Sentiment analysis helps evaluating the performance of products or services from user generated contents. Lexicon based sentiment analysis approaches are preferred over learning based ones when training data is not adequate. Existing lexicons contain only unigrams along with their sentiment scores. It is observed that sentiment n-grams formed by combining unigrams with intensifiers or negations show improved results. Such sentiment n-gram lexicons are not publicly available. This paper presents a methodology to create such a lexicon called Senti-N-Gram. Proposed rule-based approach extracts the n-grams sentiment scores from a random corpus containing product reviews and corresponding numeric rating in five-point scale. The scores from this automated procedure are compared with that of the human annotators using t-test and found to be statistically equivalent. The paper also proposes a sentiment classification methodology by using a ratio based approach based on counts of positive and negative sentences of a document. When used Senti-N-Gram lexicon, proposed method outperforms well-known unigram-lexicon based approach using VADER and an n-gram sentiment analysis approach SO-CAL."
