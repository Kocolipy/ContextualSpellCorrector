My wife developed a very severe deep hoarse cough. She has asthma but this is different. This cough is not a breathing problem. It has been going on for four months day and night. She has had every test possible, no diagnosis. Her Ct scan shows her lungs are great. Could this be conversion hysteria. She is always stressed over bills.
