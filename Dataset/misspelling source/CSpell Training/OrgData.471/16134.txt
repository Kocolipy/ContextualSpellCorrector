Urgent Enquiry  
Hi,  I wish to enquire about what other non-invasive alternatives are there in diagnosing a brain injury other than an invasive mri,ct or pet scan?  Patient has a family history of cancer and is afraid of being exposed to radiation, and is also fitted with metal discs to her neck and spine after she developed scoliosis and osteoporosis. She lives in Australia.  Your urgent reply would be much appreciated.   [NAME].
