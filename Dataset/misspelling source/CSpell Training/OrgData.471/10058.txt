Influenza.
 Is it possible to contract both Influenza A &amp; Influenza B at the same time ? If so, when positive in blood count , how is it treated, and what specific measures are taken to eradicate it, what would be the probable time frame for showing symptoms, and can they not always be full blown ? What would be incubation period for either of these types of illnesses, alone or combined ?
