Body Lice  
How do I get rid of these little devils? Me and My mom have tried so many things to get rid of these bugs and they just don't go away were the family that takes 2 showers and now about 3 showers a day we never understood how they could have infected us but I was just wondering is washing our clothes the best bet to get rid of these things, because apparently it hasn't worked for us. So is there any suggestions?
