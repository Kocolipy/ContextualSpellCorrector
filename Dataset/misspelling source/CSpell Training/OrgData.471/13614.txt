Teen pregnancy   
Good morning,   I am a student from [ORGANIZATION] on the far south side of [LOCATION]. My fellow classmates and I are conducting a research project on social issues and problems we are affected by everyday mine is Teen Pregnancy. Since I am a teenager I know how having a child can really affect our young lives. They can stop our achievements in school, goals for the future,all our fun would stop,and our dreams. I would like to ask someone from your organization a few questions because it seems as though your organization could provide me with valuable information about teen pregnancy,statistics,facts, and your opinion about it. Your time and assistance would be greatly appreciated and I hope to hear from you soon.   Thank you,  [NAME]
