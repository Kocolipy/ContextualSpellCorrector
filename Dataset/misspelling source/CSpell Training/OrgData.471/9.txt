Retinitis Pigmentosa RP stem cells, gene therapy. HI I had been diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa RP at the age of 12. I am now 27 years of age. I live in Melbourne, Australia and I am willing to travel. In the last 2 years my eyes has deteriorated quite dramatically. My central vision is good, colour and clarity is also good. My visual acuity is approx 20/80. My visual field is approx 45 degrees. My peripheral vision has began to deteriorate and my night vision is poor. I am in middle stages of RP however I am still capable of getting through my day to day activities. I have been searching on the Internet and came across your website. I am interested in any treatments or clinical trials in stem cells, gene therapy or any other treatments you may recommend I look forward to your response and any information you may be able to give. Kind Regards, [NAME]
