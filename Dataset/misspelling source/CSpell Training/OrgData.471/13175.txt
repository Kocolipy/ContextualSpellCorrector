Blood pressure  
Take blood pressure med atenolol 50mg, blood pressure running 91/59 HR65, most of the time lower in the upper to mid 80's.  My doc is not in for 3 day's.  What can I do to raise it.  I am on anxiety, pain &amp; muscle relaxers for a medical condition in my neck and legs that I can't have surgery on again.  Please how do I get my pressure back up until I can get to my doctor?  I am so tired and can't get rid of the headache.
