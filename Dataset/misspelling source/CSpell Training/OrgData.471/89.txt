ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information. Is there any information out there regarding people who have both, Charcot Marie Tooth Disease and Parkinson's ? My husband has both. Not too much info. In California about these two diseases together. However, as a care giver, this is a tough one! Any studies genetically or otherwise on these two together? Thanks, [NAME]
