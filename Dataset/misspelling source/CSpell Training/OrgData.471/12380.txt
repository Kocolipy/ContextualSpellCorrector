Irritation on the gland  
There is a problem on my penis gland, due to using lidokaine a lot. The skin is irritating and very sensitive especially when it is wet. Also, the gland is peeling every 3 or 4 days during a week leading to very high stimulating feelings. I have undergone several treatments for skin as well as my neurotic system but with no result at all. Please help me to cure this. Some doctors said there is no treatment for me and there would be no sexual contact forever.
