Please help me  
I have been dealing with undiagnosed issues. It started 3 years ago as nausea and dull achy pain. Doctors decided to remove my gallbladder, even though it only had scarring. Since the surgery (sept) I have had a sharp, stabbing random pain in that area and around it. I also get dull, crampy pain. Finally, the surgeon ordered a CT scan because the pain is so bad. His nurse called and said everything was fine. So I went to my primary, who noticed that I have ascites on my liver. My side is slightly bloated, was not before. And I am scared because I don't know what I'm supposed to do. No one will help me and I do not want to be on pain meds my whole life.  Please let me know your thoughts or guide me in the direction I need, please.  I live in south carolina, i dont know why when I made my email it had the co.uk
