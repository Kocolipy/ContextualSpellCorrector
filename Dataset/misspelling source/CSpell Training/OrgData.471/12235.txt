Glucosamine with PRGF treatment  
I have just finished my third session of PRGF treatmet(Plasma rich in growth factors) for osteoarthritis/condropathia in my knee. Would it be recommendable to also take glucosamine, or would it be counterindicative?  If so, is there any specific type or combination of glucosamine that would be best for me? I am a 65 year old male, very active especialy playing tennis and skiing, activities which I hope to eturn to very soon. hank you for any information you can provide.  [NAME], Valencia Spain
