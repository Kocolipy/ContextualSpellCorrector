Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva. I just received a new patient at the age of 3 years old with the diagnosis Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva.  She has spent the last several months in India and has come back to this country for financial reasons.  I am one of two pediatricians in the county and the closest pediatric specialist are between 1.5 to 3 hours away.  I would like the specialists that are recommended for the condition and if OT or PT is helpful for the patient.
