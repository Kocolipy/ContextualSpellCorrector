sarcoidosis.
 One thing no physician has been able to tell me is whether or not fatigue--ongoing--is a part of this disease. I was diagnosed in 2006, and have noted a lessening of energy, endurance. If this is a possible side effect, I have not found it in any info on this. Please add to your information if this is a viable issue. Thanks so much! [NAME]
