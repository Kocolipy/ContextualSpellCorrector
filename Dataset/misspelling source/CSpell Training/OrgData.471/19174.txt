Dear Sir/Mam  My name is [NAME] from [LOCATION] 28 years old. From my childhood I am suffering from Neurofibromatosis (Type 2). Last 1 year i am consulting with local dermatologist but being it is a genetic neurological disorder they not show any scope.     In this situation my family is planning for my marriage. So I am need of suggestion  1)    Whether is it prevent my child from cause and effect  2)    Can it control by spreading more     Please consider and revert back.     Regards  [NAME]  [CONTACT]
