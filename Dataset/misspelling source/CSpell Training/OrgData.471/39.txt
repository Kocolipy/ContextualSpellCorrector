Second opinion for hemifacial microsomnia. I am a 34 female born with hemifacial miscrosomnia. I have had multiple surgeries but yet I feel I am not where I would like to be. I have been treated through the military because I can not afford a second opinion from an outside source. I lack tissue, muscle and fat on the right side of my face as well as a definite under developed right mandible. I know I would never be perfect, but I would love a chance to be able to walk down the street without people staring and I for one time in my life feel some what normal. Can you please help
