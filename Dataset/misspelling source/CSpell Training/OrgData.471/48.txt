ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study. Dear Sir,I am from India. My 23 years  old son is having   Autism.  As U R well aware that this  is a genetic condition involving changes in part of the X chromosome. Most  children and Adults are suffering  from  this cause . Some studies  are going on  but no conclusion  for treatment  of autism   yet  finalized by the FDA . My son is having repetitive stereotypy movement such as hand flapping, making sound , head rolling &amp;amp; rocking etc. I am also interested to go for DSM test (Chelation therapy) to find whether there is mercury, metal etc in my son. As explain above please advise how I can go for the above test  of  my 23 years autistic son . I await your  swift  response please. Thanks & regards. [NAME]
