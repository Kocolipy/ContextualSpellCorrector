blind technology
Hello, 
I am a student doing a research project on blind technology. I am wondering if you have any contacts of people who have research information on this topic because I want to find out their opinions on certain technologies. Also, I would appreciate it if you could tell me ways to improve/cure blindness. For example, information on ' stem cell surgery', bionic eye', 'gene therapy to cure blindness' etc. Thankyou!
