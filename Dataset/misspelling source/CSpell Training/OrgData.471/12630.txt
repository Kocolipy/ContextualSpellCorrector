I had my house sprayed to eradicate crickets and spiders.  I immediately started feeling very ill. I had a very tight chest, racing heart pulse, terrible tiredness and sore throat and very sore red eyes. That was over a month ago.  I still have a very sore throat bad chest and sore eyes. Is it possible that the spray is still giving off a harmful effect in my home.  Every day I find masses of dead crickets and an assortment of flying insects lying all over my house.
