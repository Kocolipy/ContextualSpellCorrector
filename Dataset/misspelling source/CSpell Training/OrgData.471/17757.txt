Obesity Questions  
Hello. My name is [NAME] and I am a junior in high school. I am currently doing a research topic on obesity and was wondering if you would be able to answer a few questions. It would be greatly appreciated if you could! Thank you! 1)What/Who is to blame for obesity? 2)Do you think putting  a tax on junk food will reduce the amount of obese people? Why or why not? 3)How can we prevent obesity? 4)What are the benefits of getting 30 minutes of exercise daily and eating healthy? 5)Should the government be more involved in the help to stop obesity? Why or why not? 6)What is the number one thing we should eat less of/ cut out of our diets? (such as, fats, carbs, sugars,etc)  Thank you for your time!
