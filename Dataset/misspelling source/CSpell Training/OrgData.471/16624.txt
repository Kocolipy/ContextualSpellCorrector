Can a 40 year old get throat cancer...  
I have drank a lot of alcohol and lots of drugs. Not very many fruits and vegetables. This year I have gotten strep throat twice and sore throats with ear aches. Antibiotics have taken 4 different kinds this year alone. Raspy voice, very painful when swallowing.
