NUT tumor in spine. My brother had a tumor in his cheek, which was surgically removed. He is still undergoing radiations. After dissecting the tumor, they noticed it had something to do with the chromosones. His tumor was rare. Last week they discovered very small tumors in his spine. They concluded the cancer has evolved in his bones. In [LOCATION] they said only 2 cases of this cancer are known worldwide. They've given him 8 months!4 Months ago he was just fine. I'm looking for any information that can help him!
