'low levels of 10 lipids may predict dementia'  
OK. I understand your reticence to list unconfirmed 'untrigger' lipids. However, I am a trained scientist who's 72 years old, so I don't really have time to wait for confirmatory tests to be run on several K more old coots. so QUE3TION: What [NB: THE HELL] precisely are the 10 lipids in question? I would then plan to have myself checked for those 10 lipids.
