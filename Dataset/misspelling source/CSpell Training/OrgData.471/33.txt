Genetically Engineered Foods. I am a high school student currently in a science class called Bacteria Biotech and Genetics.  During my research, I came across this web site that has helped me better my knowledge on the topic of genetically engineered food.  I was wondering if you could tell me about the risks that come with genetically engineered food and how the modification is actually conducted.
