Pessary in while doing Kegels? Yes or no?  
Hi. I have been using a pessary for a number of years and was happy with the help it provided. Lately I've been experiencing prolapse worsening during and after particular exercises so I reduced those type of exercises and decided to do more kegel exercises. My question is should I remove the pessary while doing kegel exercises?
