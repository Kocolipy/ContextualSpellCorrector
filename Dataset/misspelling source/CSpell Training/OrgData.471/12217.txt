Good evening. My name is [NAME] , I am from Bosnia and Herzegovina. I'm 18 years old. I wear a cochlear implant ,hearing aid,  for 14 years. I wear it because have totally lost ability to hear. When i was eleven months old I had a fever therefor I used garamycin , but the doctors gave me too much of it so they burned my hearing nerve. I would like to know if there is any way to give me back my hearing ability without using any kind of help?     Yours faithfuly , [NAME].
