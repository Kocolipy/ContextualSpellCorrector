I have a gland on the bottom left side of my jaw that swells up and gets really hard causing pain. The only way to relieve it is to push it with my fingers till it runs out of a hole inside my cheek into my mouth. What could b causing this? I just want to know if i should b concerned about a type of cancer since my grandmother passed from cancer in her lymph nodes.
