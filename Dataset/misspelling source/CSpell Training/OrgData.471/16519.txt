Pilot and Lazy Eye  
Dear MedlinePus  I started to fly at the age of 15 and have been flying for over 3,5 years and has logged over 120 hours in my time as pilot. My dream is to become a Comerical Pilot and recently I undertook a medical class 1 which I failed in Norway because of my Eye position and Eye movment, hence I have not experienced any problem with my vision in daily life nor when I have been flying..  The problem is that my binocular vision is not good enough and the eye-doctor meant it could be a problem if I sudden developed double vision.  Is there any operation that can fix this? The Orthoptics I went to meant there was a problem with one of the eye muscles which where to thight and the other too weak. She said it can be fixed, but this is not &quot;normal&quot; in Norway because it is not big enough error she meant.  Is there anyway to fix this? I appreciate all information!  Kind Regards  [NAME]
