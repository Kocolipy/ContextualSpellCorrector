Hello, my name is [NAME] and i am a student at [ORGANIZATION] here in sacramento. I am composing a research report on SIDS and i was hoping you could help me with some information. I was particularly interested in learning weather parents should be worried about cribs death and if you could direct me to some resources on that, or even allow me to interview you. Thank you for your time. If you have anything else that might help me, i would really appreciate it. You can email me at [CONTACT] or contact me by my phone at [CONTACT]. Thanks again.
