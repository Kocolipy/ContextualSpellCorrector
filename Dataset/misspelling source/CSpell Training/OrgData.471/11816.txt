Diphtheria.
 Is there a definitive history of diphtheria in the United States available in print? I have read quite a few articles in the NLM from the 19th century, and I'd like to find an overview of this disease, particularly a history of epidemics in the U.S. Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you - [NAME]
