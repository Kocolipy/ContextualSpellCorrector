Achondroplasia research.
 Hello, We are students from [ORGANIZATION] and we are doing a biology project of genetic diseases. We chose Achondroplasia as our disease to research. We have a few question and we are hoping you could answer them. Our questions are, can you tell if your child will have Achondroplasia when you are pregnant? When do people usually come in when they think something isn't right with their child? what are the worse cases of Achondroplasia you've ever seen? Thank you in advance.
sincerely,
[NAME] and [NAME]
