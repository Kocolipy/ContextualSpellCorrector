bROKE BALL OF SHOULDER END OF NOV.  
I am going to PT each week however the next day I can bearly move my arm.   The PT person feels because I didn't start PT early (4weeks into the Break)is the reason why I am in so much pain.   I go to the  dr Monday   plan on asking him if this could be nerve damage vs, muscle damage.  I don't think you can see muscle or nerve damage on the xray, I think I need the dr to do an MRI to see the damagel    what are your thoughts,   I can not lift my are more than an inch when my arm is straight can not put my arm behind my bacj=k cant stretch to pick up anything.   When I try to fold my laundry and you shake the clothing before folding it, the pain I get in my are is exdruating, and I cry it hurts so much.   If I turn my arm the wrong way it hurts ajd I begin to ccryln n n====   The Dr office takes an xray each visit, however I don't believe he would see nerve damage.
