ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information
I am a type 1 diabetic and have been since I was nine months old.  I am now 34 and would love to talk to anyone interested in trials on the reversal vaccine that I have read articles about.  I currently live in Atlanta GA.  I was not sure if any local Endo Doctors are running trials similar, or would be interested in working with a patient that has had t1d for as long as I have.  I am very active in my community with JDRF and would love nothing more than to be cured of this terrible disease.  Please contact me via email or my cell# [CONTACT], I welcome any information that can be provided.  Thank you, [NAME]
