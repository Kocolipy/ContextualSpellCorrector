help on finding a doctor. Hi, My name is [NAME] and I am 23 yrs old. And I'm   the 3rd Generation of my family that has  CLEIDOCRANIAL Dysplasia. Then I have grown up with a  lot of mouth problems that made it difficult  for me to have the dentist work on my mouth , but I still have my baby teeth at the age of 23 years old.
