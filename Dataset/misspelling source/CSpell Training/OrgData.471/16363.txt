Alpha 1 normal ranges
Hi 

I was wondering if you could help me. I am a student in which I have to complete a case study on a patient with severe COPD. The patient's alpha 1 ant-trips sin level is 1.33. I am aware the normal ranges is 0.075-0.15g/L. Does this mean this patient has the genetic disease?
Thanking You
