Ankle Injury  
I got hurt in my left leg ankle almost 5 months ago. I went to doctor, got x-ray, where no damage was found. He suggested me some pain killers and advised me to wear anklet. I have been following the instruction since then; I went to another doctor who advised me to go for physiotherapy (Short Wave Diathermy) and advised me some exercises. I have been following them too. But yet now, I have not been fully recovered from the pain. Especially when I try to walk quickly or try to put pressure with my left leg, I feel pain. I am very tensed about this. Can you please suggest me how to overcome the pain. Thanks.
