Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. My daughter is 27 years old and about 15 months ago had a diagnostic of EDS. She has type 3. Since the diagnostic she has had two shoulder surgeries and a hip surgery. Her shoulders have already gone bad after the surgeries. It won't stop there. She has POTS and chronic pain. She is also having gastro problems. Until now she has been treated by an orthopedic surgeon and a family doctor. Her orthopedic surgeon is in Phoenix. Her primary physician is in Las Vegas. She lives in [LOCATION]. I was thinking about taking her to a molecular biology center, a geneticist. Somebody who could give her an overview of her conditions.   We are looking for a specialist, a trial, anybody who can help her find a road map on how to deal/treat EDS. Please let me know whatever you know that can help us. I am Grateful in advance for your kind consideration. Do you know of anywhere that she can be evaluated for everything not just EDS? Could she be a candidate for a the clinical trial for heritable disorders? We would travel for the exams. We will do anything that can help. She got married at eighteen and  has two boys, one is 7and the other is 6 years old.
