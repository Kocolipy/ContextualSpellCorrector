I have had Tourette syndrome since age seven. Recently at the age of 72, I had an implantation of a shunt for hydrocephalus. 

*What is the probability of one having both hydrocephalus and Tourette syndrome?
*Is there any evidence that indicates that the head and neck tics of Tourette syndrome may be a cause of hydrocephalus?
