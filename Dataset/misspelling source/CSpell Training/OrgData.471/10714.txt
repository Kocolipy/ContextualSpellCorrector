DIABITIC.
 My sister is diabitic since age 8, now age 20. she is not coping well with it, i've been to the nutrition DR.s with her and we have since change our diet at home just for her, but it's still too havy on her. i want to help her, maybe if i can get her a couselor or support group that understands her situation/diabits.
