Asthma  
I have been treated for breast cancer and had chemotherapy and readiation.  I am on many drugs but since stopping treatment I have now presented as having asthma.  I take Letrozole. 2.5 to block any estrogen in my body as my tumor was estrogen positive. What type of drugs impact asthma symptoms?   Please advise
