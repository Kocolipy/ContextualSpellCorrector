vaginal yeast infection  
Hey, my name is [NAME]. Last night my vaginal area was itching but I didn't think to much of it.  Well when I woke up this morning it started itching out of control.  I don't see discharge coming from the vaginal area.  Now I do use Summer's Eve vaginal spray, I don't know if it is a vaginal yeast infection or not, but how should I go about this process.
