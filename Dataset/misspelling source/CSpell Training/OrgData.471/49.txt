Prothesis to assist Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. My 22 yr old grandson has Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Has weak arm & hands curl inward. He has difficulty picking up a plate or opening doors. Some type of shoulder harness with support for arms could help. Something electrical like limbs for amputees. Is anything being considered in this area?
