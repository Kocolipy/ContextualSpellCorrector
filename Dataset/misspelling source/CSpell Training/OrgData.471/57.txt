ClinicalTrials.gov - Error Found - in a study. Dear all, I am [NAME] from Malaysia. My mother has suffered from MSA and it is be discovered on 2009year. I have a question. From this, it showed that this disease is not to be hereditary. I got a real life example is that my grandpa was suffered with this disease and he had passed away, follow by my uncle that had inheritated this disease. My mother also got the same disease with her father. And this disease is discovered and proven by Malaysia Government Hospital. Is that really not hereditary? If my mother suffered from this disease, what is my probability to i will get this disease? I now feel worry about my future. I scared i will got the disease from mother. Could you please reply my message? Looking forward for your precious answer. Thank you. Yours sincerely, [NAME]
