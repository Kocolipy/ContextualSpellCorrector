Tests for Haemophilia. Hi, I was wondering if blood clotting assays are always positive if one has mild-moderate hemophilia and what the name is of the genetic tests for hemophilia? I have a history of internal spontaneous bleeding into the joints or with eating garlic or onions (in large amounts). I also hemorrhage after injuries (arm injury, head injury hemorrhage, and pregnancy birth hemorrhage -- both times).  I've had to have blood transfusions and shots to control the bleeding but it's usually possible to control it. I believe I may have passed this on to my son as he was determined by a doctor to be a heavy bleeder at circumcision. While on the East Coast, I was asked by a Washington D.C. hospital if anyone had done a work-up on me for hemophilia or any clotting disorder and I said not to my knowledge.  I asked if they were going to do it and she said to follow up with a primary doctor for it.  She also said it could be expensive. This is why I'm asking, if I go to a medical appointment as a private pay patient, and want to have testing done, which tests would you recommend? [NAME]
