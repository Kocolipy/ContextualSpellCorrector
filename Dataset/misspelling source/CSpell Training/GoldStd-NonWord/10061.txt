medical articles.
 I have been told that there are several medical case studies about Loin pain hematuria syndrome (aka LPHS) and Medtronic's Symplicity Renal Denervation medical equipment and that these cases have been published by PubMed.  However, I am unable to locate them.  Can you please recommend a way for me to locate and receive copies?  Thank you!
