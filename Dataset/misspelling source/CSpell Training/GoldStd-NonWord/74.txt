Does anybody have any information on pain relief for Hirayama's disease?? My brother has had this disease for 10 yrs and when the nerve endings are dying he is in excruciating pain and is giving no pain relief for this apart from morphine which does not help nerve pain. I appreciate his consultant is trying her best with a disease she knows little about but can anybody please help or give advice or any information on pain relief for this disease. He is already on the highest dose of pregabalin but when he is bad nothing is helping for the pain. Please any help or even anybody with any suggestions would be great full.
