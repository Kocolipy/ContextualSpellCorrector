Fetal skull not closed. We recently found out that our grandchild , which is unborn and only 3 mos in the womb, has a genetic disorder where the skull is not closed . The doctor says the baby will not survive. Our daughter has been told she could carry the baby to term or could miscarry at anytime. Can you give any information on this subject. We are devastated.
