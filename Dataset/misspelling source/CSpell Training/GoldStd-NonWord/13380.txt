Please help me to understand what is happening to my daddy.  He has A-Fib and is retaining water all over his body.  He is in the hospital and the are giving him a drip of medication to slow his heart rate.  They are giving him Lasix for the water retention, but are concerned with his kidneys failing.  He is also a diabetic and takes a blood thinner also.  Can you help me to understand and maybe help him or his doctors.
