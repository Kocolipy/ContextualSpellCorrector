stretched or torn tendons / left leg.  
I have torn or stretched tendons in my wrist, or ankle, before. The one incident ended up having to be corrected through an OP. The cartilage known as Discus Triangulares grew back wrong and the scarred tissue, pushed on a nerve, causing my hand and arm to go numb.          My question concerns a fall I had about 5 weeks ago. In this fall, I hurt my left wrist, and leg, my wrist took about 3 weeks to heal up, and no longer bothers me. My left leg, however, is still bothering me. Is it possible that I tore something that is pinching a nerve in my leg?? While standing, for prolonged intervals my upper thigh tingles, as if my leg has gone to sleep. The front and side of my thigh are tender to touch, (as if I burnt myself badly, or someone hit me with something real hard.) The original pain I had, was in the back of my knee. I know that a tendon takes 8 weeks or more to heal, it has now been almost 6 weeks.
