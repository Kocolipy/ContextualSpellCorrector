Shakiness.
 I have acquired a symptom of extreme internal body shaking. Sometimes I canyon even speak right or use a pen. A doctor yesterday asked if I had a recent thyroid checkup. I see my thyroid doc the end of March.  Usually they say my T4 levels are low. I'm confused when it comes to what levels the thyroid should be.  I also have chronic fibromyalgia.  Seems that is blamed on for a lot of my problems.  Thank you for this site.
