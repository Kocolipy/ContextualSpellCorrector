Request for literature for Chromosome 16 duplication
I have 3 week old who was admitted in our NICU for being growth retarded.  He was delivered term but weighed only 1.44 kg.  There was polyhydramnios during pregnancy but the rest of the antenatal scans did not detect any other abnormalities.
When the baby was born, we noted some dysmorphism, namely:  small head, low set ears, round face with wide philtrum, slight hypertelorism, wide spaced nipples, clinodactyly and stubby toes.  blood was sent for karyotype and showed 46XY,dup(16)(q13q23).
I looked up any information about this condition and could not find any on-line.
Can you please forward any literature you may have so as I can better appraise the parents of the prognosis and make a more detailed treatment plan for the patient.

Thank you
