pierre robins syndrome. Good Morning, Just a query for you regarding the above. Is it true to say this is caused by an abnormal chromosome and is carried by the mother and transferred to boys only. This is supposed to happen 1 in 4. The male does not carry the gene. I would appreciate your expert information please.
