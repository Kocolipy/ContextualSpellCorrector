loss of ability to Taste and Smell due to surgery that acute olfactory nerve.  
Can you recommend a group  to help a patient who has lost ability to taste and small, and who is profoundly depressed, has lost enormous amount of weight, has no interest in food and is virtually not eating, has no energy and I am afraid he will die of starvation if he does not get some help.  The various doctors involved are not helping.  He needs to think of food as medicine.  He must eat but hardly does.  Have you any suggestions.
