dressings  
my dad had some skin cancer removed 3 wks ago and a skin graft was performed. The doner site is healing well, but the graft site is still very sore and having dressings changed every 2/3 days, dad isn't convinced that the wet gauze dressings are any good. Which type of dressings should be being used?
