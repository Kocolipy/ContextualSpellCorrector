genetically inherited ability to low cholesterol. Is there a medical term used for genetically inherited ability to low cholesterol? I have it, I am told 1 in 3000, have this. I'm 64 y/o, LDL 74, HDL 78, TRI 91, CHOL 170. You'd thing that this is good but my veins & arteries are struggling to keep my B/P up the older I get. All cardiology test are good, can't find a cause for low B/P below 90/60 issues. There has to be a medical term for this, what is it, what gene is this? Since I never knew my parent, what country does this originate?
