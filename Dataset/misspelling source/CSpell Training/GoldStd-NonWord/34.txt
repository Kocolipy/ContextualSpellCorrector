Customer Service Request. Doing a genealogy search, I have been contacted by a person from the same ancestral line as myself, we are descendants of the Dube/Duby ancestral line and she told me that anderson tawil syndrome runs through our Duby line, What does it look like? I understand that it changes the face features. This 82 year old great grandma would like to know more about this.   Many thanks,
