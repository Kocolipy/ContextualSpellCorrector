Craniosynostosis. My 2.5 year old daughter has this condition with the metopic, Sagittal and bicoronal sutures prematurely fusing. Do you know if any syndrome deals with those three fusing together?  She also has flabby eyelids, a flatter/wider nose, a blueish tint around her nose and the metopic suture, fat big toes, deep lines on her hands, shorter chubbier hands, somewhat sunken eyes, a butt dimple (ruled out tethered spine) and rule out a displaced anus. I am in between genetics doctors. Thanks, [NAME]
