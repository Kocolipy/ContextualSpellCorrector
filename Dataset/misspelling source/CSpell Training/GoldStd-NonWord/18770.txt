cosmetic leg shortening surgery  
Hi,  I am a tall girl (5'8"), who wants to undergo leg shortening surgery of 2 inches for cosmetic purpose. It would be good if I can get more information about it. I would like to know the cost of this surgery, the recovery time and the risks associated with it. How long should I stay in the hospital?  Thanks and regards
