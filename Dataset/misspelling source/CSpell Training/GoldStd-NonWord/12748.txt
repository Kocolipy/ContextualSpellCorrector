list of questions  
I have a list of questions about Tay sachs disease and clubfoot   1. what is TSD/Clubfoot, and how does it effect a baby  2. what causes both? can it be prevented, treated, or cured  3. How common is TSD? how common is Clubfoot  4. How can your "agency" help a women/couple who are concerned about this congenital condition, and is there a cost?  If you can answer these few questions I would be thankful, please get back as soon as you can.
