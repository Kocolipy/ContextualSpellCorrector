i have been having trouble for a few years now with fluttering in my right ear, feels like swimmers ear, like there is water in there, but the drs say there isn't any, now for about the last 6 months I have trouble sleeping, almost no sleep at all an the meds my dr has me on is Tramadol which I don't like, so i've been searching for my selp to see if it had something to do with adenoids, if I get them removed then maybe everything else will get better... please help...
