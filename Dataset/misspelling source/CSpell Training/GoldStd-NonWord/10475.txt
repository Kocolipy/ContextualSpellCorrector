Breast cancer at 84.
 My mother was just diagnosed with breast cancer. She is 84 years old, her tumor started in the milk duct and is small in size, their is a mass as well in the same breast. He is scheduled for a lumpectomy to remove both. Because of age we would like suggestions on treatment options after surgery.
