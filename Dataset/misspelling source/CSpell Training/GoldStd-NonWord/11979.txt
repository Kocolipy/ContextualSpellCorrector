I would like to get into a study for my case.
 I am a 73 year old woman with type 1 diabetes since I was 7.  My A1C's run in the high range of 5 or low 6. I have suffered from chronic constipation all my life. I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, Now Lichen Planus, and chronic depression.  I am very active but suffer from chronic pain.  How can I get into a study from home.  I live in a remote area in central Washington.  Am I as hopeless as I sometimes feel?  Phone # [CONTACT]
