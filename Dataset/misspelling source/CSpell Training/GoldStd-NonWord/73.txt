I would like to know what exactly causes the kidd virus. I was diagnosed with anti kidd jk5 in 2009. I have had 4 miscarriages since then. The latest one this past April 30th. I have seven live births with no problems during my pregnancies. Please help me to understand. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time.
