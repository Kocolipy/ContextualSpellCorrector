My age is 56 years. And i am suffering from non-toxic goiter on left neck of size about 13 cm from 5 years. My thyroid test of T3, T4, T5 are normal, FNAC test is normal and i am having no complications right now. 
1) Please suggest should i go for operation of my thyroid gland.?
2) Is Radioiodine treatment better then surgery for me?

Thanks
