ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information.
 My granddaughter was born with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome... There is very little information about this.  We are looking for the current research and treatments available.  She is 5 months old now and her leg seems to be most affected.  We want to get her help as soon as possible to address the symptoms and treat her condition.
