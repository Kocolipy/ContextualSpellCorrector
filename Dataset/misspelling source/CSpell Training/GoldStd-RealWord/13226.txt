Abscess in lungs  
Is abscess in lungs curable?  My Dad has surgery and found 2 abscess in his lungs. After a week out of surgery room, he developed fluid. The doctor is telling us they can use the syringe to remove the fluid, nothing else can be done.   There is  a small bottle attached to his surgical area which is collecting liquid from infection.  Thank you for your reply. My dad is 84 yo.
