chromosome 20 reattachment. Results of my amniocentesis states that a part of chromosome 20 broke then reattached itself to the same chromosome in a funny way.  They are unable to determine what gene if any has been affected.  Are you aware of any similar situations, and if so, what symptoms should I expect my baby to have?  Is there anyone else you suggest I contact for further information?
