Something else (below). Hello, I don't seem to know who to contact, so giving this message a go is worth a shot! My Son was diagnosed with Wang syndrome earlier this year, I know there is such limited research on this syndrome but I would really like to get as much information or find out if any other children with this case are alive?! I was wondering if you have contacts that I could contact eg your article on the web for UPD14 Thanks for your time, hope to hear back from you. [NAME]
