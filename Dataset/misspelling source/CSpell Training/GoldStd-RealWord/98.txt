IP. My daughter has IP and was diagnosed when she was born 27 years ago, she is now pregnant, what do we need to do about having her tested besides a amnio, I heard on the news 3 weeks ago about blood tests that identify chromosome problems with a blood test.... Will [ORGANIZATION] still have her medical records from way back then? At the time we belonged to [ORGANIZATION], how do we get information to her current doctor who knows nothing about this, I would not like her to have a amnio due to the chance of miscarriage.
