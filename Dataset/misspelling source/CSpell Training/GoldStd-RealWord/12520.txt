Sheehan's Syndrome  
I was diagnosed with sheehan's syndrome almost 14 years after almost dying after the birth of my daughter.  My blood level fell to 1.3 I had a partial hysterectomy following the birth.  I recently had my thyroid removed after diagnosis of cancer and was told that I am postmenopause, I am only 39 years old.  Do you have any information regarding diagnosis and misdiagnosis. What should the medical care have done to identify the syndrome?
