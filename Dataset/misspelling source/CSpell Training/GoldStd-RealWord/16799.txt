downs syndrome daughter had a stroke  
Where is there a rehab that can treat with physical therapy, from paralysis, with my 29 yr. old daughter with downs? We live in Little Rock, Ar. I would have to stay with her throughout this ordeal, as she would not understand otherwise. We have run into this problem, but there has to be a rehab dedicated to people with disabilities. [NAME]
