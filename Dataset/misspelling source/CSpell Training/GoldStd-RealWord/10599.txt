Customer Service Request.
 My daughter has Turner syndrome but she's beaten all odds. She developed on our own, got her period on her own, she is now pregnant on her own with identical twins. My question is can she have normal children or do they have more of a chance of having Turner syndrome.  My daughter has been tested many times to confirm her diagnosis of Turner syndrome and she is a full XO not mosaic but still does not display many of the characteristics. Again, I am just questioning the safety of the pregnancy and the health of the babies. Thank you for your help
