Attachment disorder.
 Ok I am 21 years old and I have Attachment disorder I had it all my life and I don't know what to do in my life. I don't let my girlfriend in or too close to me when I feel like the relationship is going good and she's getting too close I push her away or I leave and go to the next girl and my career as a pro boxer I don't want to keep doing this to her or to other people in my life. Can someone please help me. I am tired of dealing with this.
