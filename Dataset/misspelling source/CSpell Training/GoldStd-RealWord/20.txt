Sickle cell anemia mutation. Hello, i am resident of pathology. I was studying sickle cell anemia (Mckenzie clinical laboratory hematology, 2nd edition) and found that it is associated with substitution of valine for glutamic acid at SEVENTH position of B-chain. In addition to that this book says due to confusion about numbering, older literatures says change is in 6th position, but actually change is in 7th position. I went through other literatures and all of them show change is in 6th position. Now i am confused is it 6th position or 7th position.
