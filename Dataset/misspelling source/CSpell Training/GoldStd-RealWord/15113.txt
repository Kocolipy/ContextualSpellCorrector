Treatment for Nodular Goiter  
Hi,  I'm suffering from nodular goiter. The size of enlarged thyroid gland is visible, but not like a big one. I need treatment for this. Some Doctors have suggested surgery which I don't want to go through. What are the other treatment options. Also let me know the place where I can visit to consult.  Thanks, [NAME]
