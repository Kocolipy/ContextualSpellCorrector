HIV.
 Hi, I am a student at [ORGANIZATION] and I am doing a research paper on support for people living with HIV.  1. Some of the questions that the paper is over are â€“  2.What services do you provide to teens and young adults? 3. Is there an age limit? 4. Does a teen need a parent or guardian's permission? 5. Is there a cost for your services?  6. What information would you most want teens to know about living with HIV? Thank You for your time.
