Glucosamine with PRGF treatment  
I have just finished my third session of PRGF treatment (Plasma rich in growth factors) for osteoarthritis/chondropathia in my knee. Would it be recommendable to also take glucosamine, or would it be contraindicated?  If so, is there any specific type or combination of glucosamine that would be best for me? I am a 65 year old male, very active especially playing tennis and skiing, activities which I hope to return to very soon. thank you for any information you can provide.  [NAME], Valencia Spain
