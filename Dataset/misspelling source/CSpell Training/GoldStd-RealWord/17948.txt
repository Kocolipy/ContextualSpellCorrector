how to breathe  
Dear Sirs,  This may seem like a stupid question but here goes anyway.  I am 64 yrs old and a type II diabetic.  I walk frequently to stay fairly fit but always seem to get out of breath when going up even gentle hills. Today however I noticed that I could change how I breath. Thus, I could force air out using my diaphragm (ie like blowing out a candle) then relax and just let the air flow back in or I could use my diaphragm to suck in air (like breathing in the morning air) and again relax my diaphragm to push it out. I also found that I could breath faster under conscious control which seemed to help my performance. I don't know if any of this makes sense to you but I would like to know what you think and whether there are any do's and don'ts and if there is a 'better' way to breath.  Thanks very much for your help with this,  Regards,  [NAME]
