erection problems  
I am 32 yrs. old , 5.6 ft. and 68 kg wt.,  married and have a son of two years. Since last few months , I experience erection related problems during intercourse. When aroused, I get normal erection but it does not continue for long. I don’t smoke and very rarely drink. I do exercise also. I masturbate 4-5 times a week because my testicles experience pain if I don’t ejaculate after any intimacies or getting very aroused. When pain starts, if I ejaculate by masturbating, It is relieved.  I do have night erections which I find generally in the mornings. Out of tension, once I tried Sildenafil tablet also for erection. Please tell me if I am suffering from any erection related problems or any other problems. Is masturbation a cause for these?  Kindly guide me. I have not visited any doctor yet.
