I then seen a Dr [NAME] [LOCATION], he says I must lose 30 pounds before operation., he says he wants to attach mesh to hip bones thus using bigger mesh holding entire groin area! unfortunately I am getting appears to be infection in bulging area, I am a heavy equipment operator seatbelted into giant bouncing earthmovers all day, most likely moving mesh inside my groin area?
