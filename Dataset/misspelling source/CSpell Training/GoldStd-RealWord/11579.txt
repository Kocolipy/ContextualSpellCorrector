ClinicalTrials.gov - General Complaint.
 I have had undiagnosed ADHD since I was 8 years old. I sold illicit drugs from 1979-1989 in large quantities & self medicated with amphetamines as an adolescent which damaged my Brian & worsened my symptoms. Because I have had several drug induced psychotic episodes since I was busted for trafficking in 1989 & was unable to self medicate on a daily basis. I was wrongly diagnosed with schizophrenia 9 years ago. The community psychiatrist's have treated me with all the wrong medications that have made my ADHD symptoms worse & forced me to self medicate until now. I have no assets or money & I don't think it is worthwhile going on without being put on the right medication Ritalin. When I take Methamphetamines my symptoms improve & I haven't had any antipsychotic medication for 13 months & have not gone psychotic or had any negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Can you suggest any type of tests I can do to prove I have Adult ADHD or a psychiatrist I can see in Melbourne Australia. Who can help me
