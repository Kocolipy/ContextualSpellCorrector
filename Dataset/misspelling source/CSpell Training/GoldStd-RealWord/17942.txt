Hello my name is  [NAME]  and I am a 32  yr old female that has severe problems with abdominal adhesions. I have had several surgeries due to pain and complications. Now I have been vomiting for a year now every time I eat. I have had several tests done. Nothing obvious shows which leads the dr in Springfield Illinois to believe it's scar tissue pushing on my stomach wall and causing me to expel my food within 30 min of eating. I started out at over 235 pounds and am bouncing around 150-170 now.  I am in severe pain. I am tired of living off pain medicine. I need help!!!!! Please please please!!!! It all started when I had c-section for my twins in 2003. I have had to have per 6 abdominal surgeries since with the last one in 20012 total hysterectomy .   I did well for about a year. And now back to square one just with new problems. I do not want to have surgery to just remove the tissue again. Although it will give me great relief it will cause more. I need something to help inhibit the growth of tissue.  Can anyone help me?? I am very desperate!! I am tired of not being there for my girls. In so much pain!! Pain meds are hit and miss on helping and I just hate taking them. I am looking into  essential oils to help with my symptoms. It is a living hell! My e-mail is [CONTACT] please contact me if you can help. Only serious material please.
