Abnormal Growth  
I have a 11 year old grandson that does not seem to be growing normally with his age group. He has 4 other brothers & sisters 3 girls and one brother that except for the oldest {girl} all seem to be having normal growth. The 11 I am referring to is very short and stumpy 5-7 inches shorter than his friends. His father is pretty short and stumpy also. The other brother seems to have normal growth. Is there any answer to this, he is having a hard time emotionally at school.
