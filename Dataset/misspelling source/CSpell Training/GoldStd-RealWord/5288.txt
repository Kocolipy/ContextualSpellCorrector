Genetic testing.
 My mother in law is in the last stage of lung cancer and only has days to live.  My question is... testing her and comparing her tests with my husband's and his sisters' test help to determine if it is genetic?  My mother in law ([NAME]) and her mother and her mother's sister both had lung cancer and none of them were smokers.  I'm real worried about my husband getting lung cancer now and I want find out what we can do to protect him. Thank you, [NAME]
