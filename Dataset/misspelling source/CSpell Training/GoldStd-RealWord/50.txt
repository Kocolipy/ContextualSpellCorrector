diagnosis of OI/ resources. I was writing to inquire about more information regarding the diagnosis of OI.  We have family members who are in the process of waiting for genetic testing to come back but are under allegations of child abuse.  Is there any information and / or resources that may be helpful to us? Any help is appreciated. Thank you, [NAME]
