trigeminal Neuralgia.
 I had an episode with the trigeminal 2 days after i was rear-ended.  It was incredible pain that lasted 10 days. In the months following i had 2 decompression surgeries. the 1st one didn't work, was pain free for about 90 days.  The second surgery 6 months later left me with a numb face but no trigeminal pain. Could the trigeminal have been brought on from the trauma to the head from the car accident? I had been diagnosed prior to  the accident, but was not experiencing any symptoms for a long time.  Then the accident and  1 1 /2 days later i'm in a full blown episode. Please let me know what your thoughts are.
