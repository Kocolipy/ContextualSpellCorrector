cecum adhered to vaginal cuff
I am trying to find any article, photograph, or image that references to the cecum being stuck or adhered to the vaginal cuff due to adhesions from previous abdominal surgeries.  I have searched on PubMed for hours with no luck.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  It would even be helpful if there is just some type of article that lists this as being encountered by surgeons during the surgery they were performing.
