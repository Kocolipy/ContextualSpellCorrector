Healthy ageing  
I asked  my doctor what was going to happen when I got older he did not tell me anything. It is not fair that they do not tell you that certain things will happen as you age.  I had diabetes, I seem to never be able to  lower my blood sugar till I got lantus, I had high blood pressure they never told me, I could lower it with eating a proper way, , longevity was always in my family. I never met any of my family members that were sick. They were always healthy.  I met one one who was 90 years of age after she had cataract surgery she came from IA and she was still mending fences. She did not see herself as old. It was just a number. I have become sedentary because of my legs, that swell up. I have to stay seated all the time.  I am not allowed to leave my home. this is not right.  How much should a person eat who is forced to be sedentary..
