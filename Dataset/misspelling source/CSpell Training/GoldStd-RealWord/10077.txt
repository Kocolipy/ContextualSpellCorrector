ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information.
 My father's 85 and has severe hearing loss - he has tried hearing aids which at first helped but loss has become worst - has loss the hearing on one ear - hearing aids seem to cause him lots of pain
I now see that he now can't hear and is becoming isolated, which concerns me and makes me very sad and afraid he'll become very depress and not care. If you can't help us can you please direct me somewhere for help.
