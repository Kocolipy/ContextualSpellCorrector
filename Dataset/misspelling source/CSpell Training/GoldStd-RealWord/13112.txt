ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information
Can you please tell me the results of any clinical trials investigating a correlation between Buproprion (Wellbutrin) and cancer?  Is there a greater incidence of cancer rates with patients who have taken Buproprion long term as opposed to a control group?
