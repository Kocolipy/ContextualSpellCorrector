wolfram syndrome. hi i'm a support worker for a 46 yr old autistic male. reading your info provided about wolfram syndrome , he matches a lot of the symptoms. he has just recently been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and i was just doing some research about it and came across wolfram syndrome which like i said the symptoms match a lot of this guy's doings. my question that i've unfortunately been able to figure an answer out for is can adults develope this syndrome? can it be a gradual process of events/symptoms or does it happen within the first approx. 15-20 years of life? if you could get back to me with any info it would be highly appreciated because like many websites i have read not all doctors know about this syndrome.  many thanks.
