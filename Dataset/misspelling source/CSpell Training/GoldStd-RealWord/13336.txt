tongue and throat  
hi, i'm having some difficulties with tongue and throat infection... i contacted my doctor three times already, at first he gave me dactarin to put it on my tongue. and yesterday once again i visited him and i told him the medication you gave me does not work, and my infection is getting worst, he wrote a recipe for me to get terbinafine 250 mg tablet. i'm using them but then today i wake up and read some of the thrush information that you guys provide and you say 'when having thrush it is not good to have any antibiotic but that is what he's giving me and he didn't run any tests on me yet. please tell me what should i do next ?
