Customer Service Request
Hi,
We are 2 sisters and a brother. My brother at age of 24 is detected with cataract, however it is mild so operation is not required. But doctor said, there are chances he has this from Birth. However only from past 1.5 years he had a little blur vision.
And in my entire family Mom and Dad said no one has had cataract from Birth. We are a big family, my grandpa had 7 brothers and 2 sisters no one from their family or my mom has cataract from birth or even at early age. My concern is, if i am pregnant will my children have any issue like this. I and my sister, mom, dad we all have got our eyes checked. we don't have any issue. I am really tensed as i am expecting. Can you please help me with the answer.
